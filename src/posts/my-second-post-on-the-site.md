## The Second Post

Hello everyone

```razor:src/route/pages/wow.cshtml__del:2__ins:3,4
<body>
    <h1>My Astro Site</h1>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

    @foreach (var user in users) {
        Html.RenderPartial("User", user);
    }

    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
</body>
```
